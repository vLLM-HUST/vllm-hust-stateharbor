"""G0 request-owner protocol for request-owned attention.

This module is intentionally dependency-neutral: it only uses the standard
library and never imports the engine, scheduler, workers, or torch.  It
defines the wire-level protocol types (commands, receipts, batches, lease
tokens) together with two pure-Python reference implementations:

* :class:`OwnerLeaseCoordinator`: the scheduler-side reference state machine
  implementing deterministic least-committed-work assignment with local
  per-owner charges, epoch fencing for reused request ids, abandon/retry of
  provisional assignments, horizon gating, and exact-once release.
* :class:`AttentionLeaseManager`: the worker-side reference lease manager
  that consumes commands, produces receipts, and emits exactly one
  :class:`OwnerReceiptBatch` per step even when no events occurred.

Request lifecycle: ``runnable -> preempting -> waiting -> reserving ->
resumed``.  A PREEMPT receipt releases the active runnable capacity while
preserving the sticky owner/key; a later RESERVE reacquires a lease on the
same owner.  RESTORE is the separate DMA/cold-residency intent and does not
reacquire capacity.

All token counts are exact and are exclusive 0-based upper bounds: a lease
covering ``N`` tokens makes exactly positions ``0 <= position < N``
runnable, and ``N`` itself is never a legal position.  ``required_num_tokens``
and ``runnable_num_tokens`` are such counts.  A zero-token RESERVE is a legal
empty lease: it is accepted, commits zero tokens, and publishes no lease
token; a nonzero request against zero physical/reference capacity is still
rejected (``0`` is a real value, never a stand-in for a missing count).
Commands to a given owner are delivered reliably and in order: the per-owner
``command_seq`` fence increases monotonically across all request keys and
the worker consumes that stream without reordering or buffering.
Consumers integrate through the public types below. The residency snapshot is
block-ID-free and advisory to scheduler policy; it grants workers no admission
or phase authority.

G2 physical capacity vocabulary: :class:`OwnerCacheGroupSnapshot` and
:class:`OwnerCachePoolSnapshot` describe the single unified per-rank KV block
pool of Ascend DSV4 in exact block-ID-free terms (pool-wide block counts plus
per-group table facts).  The legacy logical ``free_capacity`` /
``resident_pages`` fields on receipts and batches are reference-token facts of
the G1 protocol only; they must not be used as G2 physical admission.
